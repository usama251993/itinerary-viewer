There are 2 pools to take plunge in the fall, one is 10 minutes before the fall which is bigger and better to take a bath. Another pool is right where the fall touches the ground which is smaller and risky also. The risk factor of taking a bath entirely depends the month of your visit, the fall would be too strong to take a bath during monsoons or when it rains heavily in the preceding night."
